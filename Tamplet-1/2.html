        Batman has been Gotham City's protector for decades, CEO of Wayne
        Enterprises, Patriarch of the Bat Family and veteran member of the
        Justice League. Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and
        writer Bill Finger. The character made his first appearance in Detective
        Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne.
        Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train
        himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed
        costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave, beneath
        Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth. The Dark Knight
        fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters' roots in
        film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess
        any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect,
        detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and
        intimidation in his war on crime.
